# Why Pull Requests?
As a group, we understood the importance of requiring pull requests before every merge attempt, especially when working with as big of a team as we have with this project. This system allows us to catch potential logic errors before the have a chance to affect the software in a negative way. It also allows us to make sure that all integrated code can follow a consistent style to promote readibility. Since we still wanted to support the ability to merge code without having to require a code review, we didn't implement any sort of restrictions. Instead we just let the individual programmer decide when not to submit a merge as a pull request. Their decision will made based on the conditions listed below.

# Pull Request Exceptions
While planning out the special cases that would require us to make an exception to the pull request rule, we decided that we should primarily consider the impact of each commited file on the software architecture as a whole. When committing a piece of new documentation, we allow the developer to immediately push them and merge pull requests, provided that they proofread it themselves. We only suggest submitting a pull request for documentation, when you think that a secondary look could benefit the work. In terms of submitting actual code, we would only permit the self-merging of pull requests in dire circumstances, (ie. Vital bug fixes a few hours before a due date, when no other teammate is available).
