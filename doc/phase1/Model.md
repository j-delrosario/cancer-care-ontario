## Models

The UML domain model for our database can be found in [this doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ny4WJuD_Y7bnGSMdwhTZ41SRplNb4XAQ/view?usp=sharing).
The view models that are sent to the client are effectively JSON versions of those models. The endpoints of the server which externalize the models of the database are found in [this doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10WkqDTKmEWvZvn-AbuJtT3oWndD8hHIu/view?usp=sharing).
