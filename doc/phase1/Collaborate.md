## Competancies and Constraints

# Competancies

Every developer on our team works well with React, Express, NodeJS and MongoDB. As such, we chose to use the MERN stack for our application. We've already decided on meeting at 2pm on Mondays.

# Constraints

We are all students, so we do have some constraints in the form of time constraints. For example, midterms, assignments and more. As such we have to be careful in terms of giving out work and be honest when it comes to how much work we are able to do in a sprint's worth of time.

## Meetings

Our plan for meetings to keep them weekly at the very least and we can add on to them depending on the situation in terms of conflicts and constraints. We plan to hold these meetings on the Discord server that was created for our team. 

Currently, we meet on Mondays from 2-3 for our Weekly Spring Meeting, in this meeting we discuss what we have done, what we are currently doing, and what we are planning on doing for the rest of the week as well as any blockers that have come up. In this way, everyone is on the same page. The last part of the meeting is for getting help on current issues or work that may be in the way as we believe that getting different perspectives can help the process move faster.

## Shared Documents

Currently, all of our documents have links on our discord server. We created a special channel so that our documents do not get lost in some of our text conversations on the discord server. Along with this, we have a channel for questions on the backend and frontend, a channel for important dates, and lastly a channel for meeting plans.

## Organization Methods and Tools

For organization methods, we plan to use agile approach to software development. Firstly, for agile we plan to use sprints to divide the work since it allows us to balance our work into sprints instead of just completing them in a waterfall fashion.

In terms of what our team has used to stay organized, we decided on using JIRA as we are most comfortable with the platform due to our prior experiences with it. What we wanted to get out of using Jira was the basic uses of a kanban board for current sprint organization (sprint backlog, in progress, done) as well as organizing our multiple different tasks into sprints per phases similar to what the course has already defined for us. 

Our plan is to break the application down into decoupled parts so that we are all able to work on them without running into any issues in terms of linked stories that may block each other. From there we have a list of all stories that will be completed, we divide those into three separate sprints and work on them accordingly.

## How to Divide Work

Our team of 7 has split up into two smaller teams that collaborate. The first team is the front-end and they are responsible for only the WebClient or the client-side of things. The second team is the back-end team that is responsible for the endpoints which include the API and Database configuration.

Here is how our team is divided:

# Front-end Team
Ahmad Fakhry,
Kabir Virji,
Chantal Sorias,
Rebecca Choi,

# Back-end Team
Gabriel Bailey
Jordan Del Rosario
Arjun Jolly Marlier

In addition to this, we have assigned Ahmad Fakhry to be the Continous Integration conifgurator using Travis CI. The tests will be written for each feature by the person that created that feature.

## Communication Methods

In terms of communication, we use to modes. The primary and preferred way of communicating is by voice over Discord. We prefer this because its our instant form of communication where feedback is gotten immediately. Our secondary mode of communication is using text on the discord server, this is usually to discuss smaller topics that do not require a full meeting to discuss. 

## Progress Tracking

We plan to track our progress using Jira, after a developer is assigned a task, it is their responsibility to track its progress using the Jira tools. This includes fields like how much they put in, which subtasks they may have completed, and whether or not the task is completed or not. The delegation of work would allow us to have a better view of everyone's individual stories without having to ask everyone individually everyday.
